    # Paul Morphy Opera Game

    ```The Opera Game``` is Paul Morphyâ€™s legendary chess masterpiece played in 1858 at the Italian Opera House in Paris against Duke Karl and Count Isouard. <br/>

    This short but brilliant game is famous for its elegant sacrifices and perfect demonstration of rapid development and coordination. <br/>
    
    It remains one of the most celebrated examples of classical attacking chess and is beautifully visualized here with ```react-chessboard-ui```. <br/>

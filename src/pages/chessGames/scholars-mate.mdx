    # Scholar's mate

    ```Scholar’s Mate``` is a quick four-move checkmate that targets the weak ```f7``` (or ```f2```) square using the queen and bishop. <br/>
    
    It’s a classic beginner’s trap that teaches the power of early piece coordination and the risks of neglecting defense.

    This elegant demonstration of tactical play is beautifully visualized here with <br/>```react-chessboard-ui```.

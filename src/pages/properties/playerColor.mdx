# playerColor
To set the color of the piece that can only be played, the player's color must be selected. 
If the *playerColor* has been selected, then the positions of the pieces 
of the other color can only be changed by [change](/properties/change) properties.
<br/>

```ts
type playerColor = "white" | "black";
```

### Code
```jsx
const App = () => {
    return (
        <ChessBoard 
			FEN="rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"
			onChange={handleChange}
			onEndGame={handleEndGame}
            change={change}
            playerColor="white"
		/>
    );
}
```

### Example
<div class="component-preview">
    <ChessBoardPlayerColor client:load />
</div>
